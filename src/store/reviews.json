		"review": " I recently started practicing law in Pakistan. As a graduate of University of London, understanding Pakistani legal system and practices has been my biggest challenge. This is where ELawFirm has really helped me. The law firm I interned at was using ELawFirm. I was a able to see all case files ahead of meetings, use sample contracts and pleadings for drafting. As far my learning experience goes, this technology has given me a lot edger over my peers in the profession."
